The KNN model achieved a higher accuracy than the LDA model, respectively 69 % of KNN accuracy compared to 57 % accuracy of the LDA model in test sets. This indicates that non-parametric method of KNN based on this paper detects better the compexity of accelometer data to animal behavior classes. Boundaries between behaviors may be non-linear and KNN models capture and handle nonlinearity compared to LDA that is a linear model. Some animal behaviors may be difficult to separete from each other which causes overlapping, and affects the model performances. As LDA assumes equal class variances, the class imbalances affects the performance of the model (James et. al, 2021). 
This study on the animal behavior classification by accelerator technology encourages future research, using other machine learning techniques and prediction tools to potentially find robustness and accuracy of future models. This technology could be used across different fields where a better understandment of how to predict animal behavior can help to ensure for instance endangered species.
